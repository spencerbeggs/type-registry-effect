 * `Effect.serviceOption`, so no requirement is added to any signature and
 * absence is a no-op. The library performs no `Effect.log` of its own — the
 * host owns presentation.
 *
 * Schema-backed (the store `CacheEventPayload` precedent) because events
 * cross the library/host boundary and hosts ship them to telemetry. Narrow
 * with `switch (event._tag)` or `Match`.
